# Blog

This is a toy project to practice what I've learned in Rails thus far. It's a blog with two models - posts and comments - with the functionality to create, edit and delete posts, as well as to post comments on individual posts.

The next stage of Rails learning for me is getting into authentication and authorization, but I wanted to practice the basics of routing, controllers, views and forms before I move on.

I tried to do as much as I could without reference to tutorials, but I did use the Rails Guides Getting Started section for difficult parts - for instance updating a resource with a form.

## Todo

Use Bootstrap to create a passable front-end for the blog. It obviously looks extremely ugly at the moment.
